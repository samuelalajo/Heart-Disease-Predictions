This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on a dataset of 303 records with 14 features. The data was collected from Peterside Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria, and it includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and others. The aim of the project is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease, which can help medical professionals at Peterside Hospital to diagnose and treat patients.
